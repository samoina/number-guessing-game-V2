# Number Guessing Game Version 2
This is an 'upgraded version of the number guessing game that I did in a previous repo. The challenge that I faced intiially was the many parameters I had to reset once the game was over and the UI logic needed to get back to what it was. In Brad's video series I learned about the reload() method on the Window object.

## Project Description
This mini-project is a little fun game that allows a user to guess a number in 10 turns or less. The game will let the user know if they got the number correct, in which case they can start a new game. If the guesses are wrong by the 10th turn, the game ends and the user gets to see what the correct answer was. At this point, they can also start another game.

## Project Status
This project's functionality is similar to the first one I did, but I reduced some of the code because I had too many parameters to reset when the game was over. I got some inspo from Brad's tutorial and used the reload() method on the window.location object.

## Project Context
This mini-project is my way of crystallising my understanding of Javascript concepts and practising as I go along in my self-taught journey. Daily practice, pushing to Git, writing this README and sharing on Twitter is helping to improve my skills.

## Technologies
This mini-project uses HTML, Javascript and Skeleton, a light CSS framework

## Roadmap
Create more mini projects like this one to keep myself going.
